#Topic modeling: application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation

In this project, we look at sport news articles from The Guardian from Q1 and Q2 2022, and attempt topic modelling.

For this we implement a Bayesian approach towards topic modeling, which is Latent Dirilecht Analysis (LDA). The goals are both to test the reliability of the algorithm, in face of mixed reviews in literature, and draw potential insights.
