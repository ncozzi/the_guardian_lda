# Topic modeling: application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation

In this project, we look at sport news articles from The Guardian from Q1 and Q2 2022, and attempt topic modelling. The Guardian API is used to mine data.

For this we implement a Bayesian approach towards topic modeling, which is Latent Dirilecht Analysis (LDA).
